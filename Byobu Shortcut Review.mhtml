To configure custom keybindings in Byobu, you can modify the keybindings file called ~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux. Follow these steps:

Open a terminal or console session.

Use a text editor of your choice to open the keybindings.tmux file. For example, you can use the nano editor with the following command:

Copy
nano ~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux
```

````

Inside the keybindings.tmux file, you'll find a list of predefined keybindings. Each line represents a specific keybinding and its associated command.

To define a custom keybinding, add a new line in the following format:

sql_more
Copy
bind-key -n &lt;key&gt; &lt;command&gt;
```

Replace `&lt;key&gt;` with the key combination you want to use for the binding (e.g., `Ctrl-F1`, `Shift-F2`), and replace `&lt;command&gt;` with the command you want to execute when the keybinding is triggered.

````

Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.

To apply the new keybindings, either restart your Byobu session or reload the keybindings using the following command:

Copy
byobu-config reload
```

This will refresh the keybindings and make your custom keybindings active.

````
With these steps, you can configure custom keybindings in Byobu to suit your preferences and workflow. You can define keybindings for various actions, such as switching between windows, splitting panes, or executing specific commands.

Can you provide examples of common keybindings in Byobu?
